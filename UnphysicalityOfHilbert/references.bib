	abstract = {We show that Hilbert spaces should not be considered the ``correct'' spaces to represent quantum states mathematically. We first prove that the requirements posited by complex inner product spaces are physically justified. We then show that completeness in the infinite-dimensional case requires the inclusion of states with infinite expectations, coordinate transformations that take finite expectations to infinite ones and vice-versa, and time evolutions that transform finite expectations to infinite ones in finite time. This makes Hilbert spaces physically unsound as they model a potential infinity as an actual infinity. We suspect that at least some problems in quantum theory related to infinities may be ultimately caused by the wrong space being used. We strongly believe a better solution can be found, and we look at Schwartz spaces for inspiration, as, among other things, they guarantee that the expectation of all polynomials of position and momentum are finite, their elements are uniquely identified by these expectations, and they are the only space closed under Fourier transform.},
